Every artist learns by sketching from life, and I am no exception to this rule. I have become fond of sketching animals, especially squirrels, for their dynamic poses, lovely texture and the challenge of porportion and lighting. Here are some examples of my work:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/sk-sq-1.jpg" title="Squirrel with Mushroom" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/sk-sq-2.jpg" title="Squirrel Looking" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/sk-sq-3.jpg" title="Squirrel with Madness" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Hand drawn squirrel pictures, each done with a simple mechanical pencil, a 2b pencil and a kneadable eraser.
