To improve my hard surface modeling skills, I chose a subject from my childhood: the Emancipator mech from the video game Starsiege. This is the first mech you play as when you start the game and provided an ample challenge for my level of skill, taking more than a month of time.

In the end, it was slightly over 10,000 faces.
